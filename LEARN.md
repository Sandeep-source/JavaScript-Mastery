## How did I build this repo ?

I started learning key concepts of JavaScript from all the online resources available. Mainly, I went through   [JSM's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7T23Xzys-A)  on crash course in Javascript and documented my learning at each step. One book I referred mainly was Eloquent Javascript by Marijn Haverbeke.
